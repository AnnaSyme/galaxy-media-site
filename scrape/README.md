# Scrape data from old website

The old Jekyll website has a bunch of content (events, people, news items...) embedded in markdown files. This content needs to be scraped somehow and parsed into a CSV file that can be bulk-imported into the new site database.

- For news and events, maybe not all need to be scraped? On past 1 year etc? This could be done manually.
