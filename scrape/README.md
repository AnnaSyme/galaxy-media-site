# Scrape data from old website

The old Jekyll website has a bunch of content (events, people, news items...) embedded in markdown files. This content needs to be scraped somehow and parsed into a set of TSV files that can be bulk-imported into the new site database.

This folder contains a set of scripts that have been used for this purpose, though currently they are not properly packaged for re-use. If there seems to be demand for another Galaxy to use this site then I could package this code to allow others to parse their Jekyll data and load it into the new app database.
