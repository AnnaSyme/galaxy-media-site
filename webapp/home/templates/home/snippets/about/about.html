  The UseGalaxy.* initiative
</h3>

<p>
  <strong>Galaxy Australia</strong> is one of the large Galaxy servers that make up the <strong>usegalaxy.*</strong> initiative. Along with <strong>Galaxy Europe</strong> (<a href="https://usegalaxy.eu">usegalaxy.eu</a>) and <strong>Galaxy Main</strong> in the USA (<a href="https://usegalaxy.org">usegalaxy.org</a>), the <strong>usegalaxy.*</strong> servers aim to provide a global publicly available bioinformatics resource, present a similar look and feel, similar installed tool sets and reference data and indices.
</p>

<p>
  We do this via a network of globally distributed
  <a href="https://galaxyproject.org/admin/reference-data-repo/">data servers</a>
  and
  <a href="https://github.com/usegalaxy-au">open-source code</a>.
  For more information on usegalaxy.* see the
