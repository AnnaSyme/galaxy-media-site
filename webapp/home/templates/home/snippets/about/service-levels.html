<h1>Service commitments</h1>

<h3>Best effort operations</h3>

<p>
  We realise that the jobs you submit to Galaxy Australia are important to you.  For that reason, we commit to making best efforts to keep the service as reliable and responsive as possible, and to keep your data intact.
</p>

<p>
  Our operational staff work normal Australian East Coast office hours. During those hours we aim to triage tickets, tool requests and reference data requests within one business day. Resolution of tickets, requests, outages and issues will take longer outside normal office hours, on weekends, and on public holidays.
</p>

<p>
  Galaxy Australia runs on a combination of research-grade and commercial-grade infrastructure contributed by our
  <a href="#operational-partners">Operational Partners</a>.
  Galaxy Australia reliability and capacity may be impacted if partner infrastructure unexpectedly becomes unavailable.
</p>


<h3>Service capacity</h3>

<p>
  Galaxy Australia is underpinned by significant compute and storage capabilities, allowing you to scale analysis beyond your desktop computer. We periodically expand capacity, taking into account growth in users, jobs and community requests for new types of analysis that might need specialised hardware.
</p>

<p>
  From time to time Galaxy Australia may reach capacity, usually resulting in longer job run times.
</p>

<p>
  Galaxy Australia aspires to operate a “fair share” system, where capacity is distributed amongst researchers using the service.  For that reason, we may at times work with researchers to halt and reconfigure jobs that are taking too large a share of service capacity.
</p>


<h3>Service lifetime</h3>

<p>
  The service will continue for the lifetime of the Australian BioCommons, which is currently funded until June 2023.
</p>

<p>
  In case of closure of the service, registered account holders can download their hosted data and content via Galaxy’s existing
  <a href="https://galaxy-au-training.github.io/tutorials/modules/galaxy-data/">export mechanisms</a>.
</p>


<h3>Maintenance</h3>

<p>
  The maintenance and administration of Galaxy Australia is a balance between service uptime and the health of the service.  From time to time, the service may become unavailable during planned or unscheduled maintenance events.
</p>

<h5>Planned maintenance</h5>

<p>
  Galaxy Australia Operational Partners plan upgrades and security patches to the service. During these planned maintenance periods, the service may not be available.
</p>

<p>
  Notification of planned service unavailability will be made via a notice on the Galaxy Australia website
  <a href="https://usegalaxy.org.au/">https://usegalaxy.org.au/</a>
  and via email to registered account holders. The period of notice varies depending on the length of the planned service unavailability:
</p>

<div class="textbox text-center">
  <table class="table table-striped">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Planned Downtime</th>
        <th>Advanced Notice period</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>

    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>&lt; 10 minutes</td>
        <td>Without notice</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>1 hour</td>
        <td>1 day</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>1 day</td>
        <td>1 week</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>1 week</td>
        <td>1 month</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>


<h5>Unscheduled maintenance</h5>

<p>
  On occasion, the Galaxy Australia Operational Partners may need to perform urgent maintenance (e.g. for urgent security patching) resulting in Service downtime outside of scheduled and planned maintenance windows. In this case Galaxy Australia will make every effort to give users as much advance notice as is possible to limit disruption.
</p>


<h3>Managing hosted data quotas</h3>

<p>
  Galaxy Australia is not designed for long term storage of data. Please only host data for the period required for analysis, and export/download and delete your analysed data. Any data marked by you as "deleted" will be permanently removed within 5 business days. If you decide to "purge" a dataset, it will be removed immediately and permanently.
</p>

<p>
  Old data are periodically purged in line with the data retention period described above.  We will notify you via email (to the email address used for registration) with instructions on how to download your data one week before purging your old data.
</p>

<p>
  An increased data storage quota can be
  <a href="#TODO">requested</a>
  for a limited time period in special cases.
</p>

<p>
  If your data is likely to be used by other researchers, you may
  <a href="#TODO">request</a>
  its addition to Galaxy Australia as reference or annotation data for community use. Reference and annotation data does not count towards your research data quota.
</p>


<h5>What happens when I go over my hosted data quota?</h5>

<p>
  Your data and histories are still accessible, but you are not able to run new jobs or import more data.
</p>
