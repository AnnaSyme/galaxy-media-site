  <p>
    Galaxy Australia provides advanced features and extended quotas to publicly funded Australian researchers, as described in our
    <a href="#feature-catalogue">Feature Catalogue</a>.
    Access to these features and quotas is available to account holders registered using an email address from one of the Australian Research Institutions recognised as listed in the table below.
  </p>

  <p>
    This table is based on the NHMRC list of
    <a href="https://www.nhmrc.gov.au/funding/manage-your-funding/nhmrcs-administering-institutions">Approved Administering Institutions</a>.
    We acknowledge that this list may not be exhaustive. Please
    <a href="request/support">contact us</a>
    to request the addition of your research institution to this list.
  </p>

  <!-- Something like this: -->
  <!--
    <div class="border rounded textbox mb-5 p-3">
    <p class="text-bf">Does my email address qualify?</p>
    <input class="form-control is-invalid" type="text" placeholder="myemail@example.com">
    <small class="text-danger">This email address is not qualified as an Australian Institution.</small>
