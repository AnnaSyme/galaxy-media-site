      <strong>Galaxy Australia</strong>
      is designed for data analysis and not for long term storage of data.
    </p>

    <br/>

    <p>
      Use Galaxy Australia to host your input data only for the period required for analysis.
      Also, remember to export/download your analysed data as this also will not be stored
      beyond the limits set out below.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is

      <u>your responsibility</u>

      as a user of the system to manage your own data and routinely remove both your input and
      output data from this community system to enable capacity for other users. Any data that
      is not removed by you within a defined time period (see below) will be automatically and
      permanently deleted.
    </p>

    <p>
      Galaxy Australia maintains a collection of frequently used reference genomes and
      annotation datasets. The inclusion of additional reference genomes and/or annotation data
      on the system for community use can be

      . Galaxy Australia's hosting of all reference and annotation data does not count to your
      quota and it is the best way to access reference/annotation data.

      Registered users from Australian publicly funded research organisations have a 600GB data

      Registered User's data (i.e. datasets, histories) will be available on the system for 1
      year (52 weeks) from the point of upload or creation. Within this period, any data marked
      by a Registered User as "deleted" will be permanently removed within 5 days. If a
      registered user "purges" the dataset, it will be removed immediately and permanently.
