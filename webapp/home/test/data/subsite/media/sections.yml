              We recommend subsampling large data sets to test tools and workflows.
              A useful tool is
              <code>seqtk_seq</code>,
              setting the parameter at "Sample fraction of sequences"

              Yes. Galaxy Australia has assembly tools for small prokaryote genomes as well as larger eukaryote genomes.
              We are continually adding new tools and optimising them for large genome assemblies
              - this means adding enough computer processing power to run data-intensive tools, as well as configuring
              aspects such as parallelisation
